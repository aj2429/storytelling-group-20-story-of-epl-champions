## Project Goal and Description
To extract EPL match statistics for the 2015-16 season, to perform descriptive analysis and express how Leicester won the Premier League title through vivid and elusive data visualization techniques.

We aim to visualize that all teams in the given EPL season, where did a given team stand as compared to others in given EPL seasons and how did they progress eventually with every season. In the end, we also want to determine how Leicester clinched the trophy and was the most dominant EPL team in the given tenure.

## Implementation of the Story 
### 1. Leicester City Timeline Chart (Vertical Storyboard)
* A vertical timeline which depicts the story of Leicester over the years until they reach EPL Season 2015-’16.
* From this visualization, we can understand the build-up of the story of how Leicester City overcome their failures and rise up to the EPL Throne.

### 2. Dynamic Game News Events with Multi-Line Chart (Horizontal Timeline):
* A horizontal slider which depicts the game-by-game highlights of the matches played by Leicester City in Season 2015-’16.
* A D3 Interactive Visualization is created to show the journey of Leicester City towards the EPL Triumph. It shows the game-by-game analysis that shows the path that Leicester City took to what many are calling the most remarkable championship in professional soccer history and beat the odds of 5000-to-1.
* The example shown below shows that when we hover over the game number in the line chart, you can view the highlights of the matches and understand the journey of the team to win the championship.
